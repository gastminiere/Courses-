Mwana Malenga's journey takes him to different countries and cultures, such as India, China, Egypt and Ethiopia. He learns from various teachers and masters, such as a yogi, a monk, a magician and a philosopher. He also encounters various challenges and dangers, such as robbers, pirates, wild animals and natural disasters. He uses his wit, courage and poetry to overcome them. He also writes poems about his experiences and sends them to Nuru, who waits for him patiently.
 
After many years of traveling, Mwana Malenga returns to his homeland with a wealth of knowledge and wisdom. He reunites with his father and his beloved Nuru, who has followed him secretly. He becomes a renowned poet and a respected leader. He also shares his stories and lessons with his people and inspires them to seek knowledge and beauty in the world.
  
The story of Mwana Malenga is an example of how Alfu Lela Ulela combines elements from different sources and traditions. The story is influenced by the Arabic story of Hayy ibn Yaqzan, which is about a boy who grows up on an island and learns about nature and God. It also draws from the Swahili oral tradition of utendi, which is a form of epic poetry that narrates historical events and heroic deeds. The story also reflects the Swahili cosmopolitanism and openness to other cultures and religions.
