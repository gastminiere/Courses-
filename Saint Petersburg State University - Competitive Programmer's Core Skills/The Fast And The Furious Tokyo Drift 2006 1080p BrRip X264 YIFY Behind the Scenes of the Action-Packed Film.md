Directed by Justin Lin, the film stars Lucas Black as Sean Boswell, a rebellious teenager who moves to Tokyo to live with his father after getting into trouble with the law in America. There, he gets involved in the underground world of drift racing, a style of driving that involves sliding around corners at high speeds. He also clashes with Takashi (Brian Tee), the nephew of a Yakuza boss and the king of the drift scene. Along the way, he befriends Han (Sung Kang), a former associate of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and falls in love with Neela (Nathalie Kelley), Takashi's girlfriend.
