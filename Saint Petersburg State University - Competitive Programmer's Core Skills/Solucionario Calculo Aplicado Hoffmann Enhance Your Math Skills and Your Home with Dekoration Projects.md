- Make a Fibonacci spiral with seashells, pinecones, or other natural objects. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers that starts with 1 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. For example, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. The Fibonacci spiral is a curve that approximates the golden ratio, which is a proportion that is considered to be aesthetically pleasing. You can create a Fibonacci spiral by arranging objects in a spiral pattern according to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, you can start with one seashell, then add another one next to it, then two more next to them, then three more next to them, and so on. You can also use other objects that have Fibonacci numbers in their shapes or patterns, such as sunflowers, pineapples, or artichokes.
- Create a fractal art piece with paper or cardboard. A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar, meaning that it looks the same at different scales or levels of magnification. For example, a snowflake is a fractal because each branch of the snowflake has smaller branches that look like the whole snowflake. You can create a fractal art piece by cutting out shapes from paper or cardboard and repeating them in smaller sizes. For example, you can cut out a square from a sheet of paper, then cut out four smaller squares from each corner of the square, then cut out four smaller squares from each corner of those squares, and so on. You can also use other shapes such as triangles or circles. You can glue the pieces together to form a larger shape or arrange them on a wall or a board.
- Make a Sierpinski triangle with toothpicks and marshmallows. The Sierpinski triangle is another example of a fractal that is made of smaller triangles that look like the whole triangle. You can make a Sierpinski triangle by connecting toothpicks with marshmallows to form triangles. Start with one large triangle made of three toothpicks and three marshmallows. Then make three smaller triangles inside the large triangle by connecting the midpoints of each side with toothpicks and marshmallows. Then make three smaller triangles inside each of those triangles by connecting the midpoints of each side with toothpicks and marshmallows. And so on. You can make as many levels of triangles as you want or as your materials allow.

These are just some of the many ways you can use the Solucionario Calculo Aplicado Hoffmann to decorate your home with math. You can also experiment with other math concepts such as geometry, algebra, trigonometry, or statistics. You can use different materials such as wood, metal, fabric, or plastic. You can also mix and match different styles and colors to suit your taste and preference. The possibilities are endless!
