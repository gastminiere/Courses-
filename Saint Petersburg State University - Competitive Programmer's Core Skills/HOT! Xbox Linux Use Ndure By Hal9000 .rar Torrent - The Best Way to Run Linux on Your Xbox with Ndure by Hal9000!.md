## What You Need
 
Before you start, make sure you have the following items:
 
- An original Xbox console with a working DVD drive and at least 2 GB of free space on the hard drive.
- A copy of MechAssault, Splinter Cell, or 007: Agent Under Fire (the original versions, not the Platinum Hits or Classics editions).
- A USB flash drive formatted as FAT32 with at least 256 MB of space.
- A USB to Xbox controller adapter (you can buy one online or make one yourself).
- A computer with an internet connection and a DVD burner.
- A blank DVD-R or DVD+R disc.

## Step 1: Download Ndure by Hal9000 and Xbox Linux ISO
 
The first step is to download Ndure by Hal9000 and the Xbox Linux ISO file from the internet. You can find them on various torrent sites or online forums. The file names are usually something like `HOT! xbox linux use ndure by hal9000 .rar torrent` or `xbox_linux_use_ndure_by_hal9000_6nck`. Make sure you download the latest versions and check the file integrity with a checksum tool.
 
Once you have downloaded the files, extract them to a folder on your computer. You should see two files: `ndure-3.1.exe` and `xbox-linux-ndure-02.07.08.iso`. The first file is the Ndure by Hal9000 installer and the second file is the Xbox Linux ISO image.
 
## Step 2: Run Ndure by Hal9000 Installer
 
The next step is to run the Ndure by Hal9000 installer on your computer. Double-click on `ndure-3.1.exe` and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to select your Xbox version (v1.0-v1.5 or v1.6), your game (MechAssault, Splinter Cell, or 007: Agent Under Fire), and your USB flash drive letter. The installer will then copy some files to your USB flash drive and create a save game exploit for your game.
 
When the installer is done, eject your USB flash drive from your computer and plug it into your Xbox controller adapter. Turn on your Xbox and insert your game disc. Load the game and go to the load game menu. You should see a corrupted save game with a strange name. Select it and press A. The game will crash and Ndure by Hal9000 will launch.

You will need to choose a partition size for Linux (at least 2 GB), a kernel version (2.4 or 2.6), a distribution (Gentoox or Xebian), and a boot mode (dual boot or single boot). The installer will then format your hard drive and copy the Linux files to it.
